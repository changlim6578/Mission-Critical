So here is the story. Me and my friends are making a video game. We want it to be amazing, and we have ideas and everything,
but we need help.
We do not know how to record sounds
We do not know how to draw
We do not know how to code.
We need major help, and when we finish this, if you have helped, your name will be added within game, but lets not look into the future and
focus on the present. So in all, we need help. Is there any ideas?
